Studying manifold embeddings for word and image embeddings from the embedding layers of appropriately deep neural nets.

## Data
Some data used in notebooks is omitted from the repo due to file size for now.

- `text_features.h5` contains the embedding vectors for each of the words in `text_words.txt`, which in turn contains a standard Scrabble dictionary.
